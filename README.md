# scraping-for-cce
This code is created for Center for Community Energy's county heat pump project.

The main idea is to search and collect related apartments' contact information for future connecting with people managing apartments in CA's counties.
The code includes two parts. One is a project to search in apartments.com. The second half is a project to search directly in Google. 

The main codes used to scrape for CCE here is the second project which scrapes Google.com;

Package Seleniem is used as a tool to accomplish the collecting job here. It works as a simulator for web and it automated searching and collecting info from websites.
